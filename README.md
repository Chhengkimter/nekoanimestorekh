front end varaint logic: for product with charcater name just let them note in order

change customer option name to varaint because we dropped product option and replaced with variant instead

if order has not been confirmed by admin yet, admin can modify the order and customer will see it is marked as modified by admin and the order would be move to confirmed by dafault seen the admin already look at it and modify it. Also since my store polocy is that customer can pick between full payment (include shipping) or they can pay 50% first for pre order item then pay the rest when its arrived. Plus, cash on delivery is available for the last 50% and product that are instock but only if location in pp would cash on delivery be possible. for province always full payment before shipping so here is the flow.
 1. customer order pre order product: pay 50% -> order sent -> awaiting confirmation => confirmed -> shipped -> deliveried
 2. customer order instock product (inventory is not 0): fill address, make a feild where we make a check box asking if location is in phnom penh => if phnom 3.penh ask if they want cash on delivery or full paymnet on website -> order sent -> awaiting confirmation -> confirmed -> shipped -> deliveried
 3. customer order both pre order and instock product: same logic as pre order product
As for admin flow in case we need to modify order  (modify only available if order is not confirmed) it will show to customer that their order has a modified status and they will received a notification (implementing later)
